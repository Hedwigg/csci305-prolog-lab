Name something you like about Prolog. Explain.
  I like how powerful unions actually are in prolog. In other languages you don't really use unions to do a lot of things but prolog harnesses their full potential and you can create some really interesting functions that way.

Name something you dislike about Prolog. Explain.
  Logic statements are harder to come up with because you aren't giving the computer steps to compute. You have to come up with more complicated queries to find the answer you need.

Did you enjoy this lab? Which aspects did you like and/or dislike?
  I did enjoy this lab. It was fairly straightforward and because you can put in your own rules for your own family it was easy to test and debug. I didn't really like using the swipl-win program because it was a little buggy and confusing at times but thats what happens when you run windows so it wasn't a huge deal.

Approximately how many hours did you spend on this lab?
~ 6 hours.

Do you think you will use Prolog again? For which type(s) of project(s)?
  I'm not sure if I will ever use prolog again personally but if I was ever involved in software that uses relational databases I'm sure prolog would be a great option for me.
